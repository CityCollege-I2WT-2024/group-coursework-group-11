          <h1>Social Media</h1>

          <h2>Social Media Platforms: A Privacy Minefield</h2>
          <p>
            Diving into social media? It's like walking through a privacy
            minefield. Platforms such as Facebook and Instagram are notorious
            for collecting heaps of your personal data—from your location to
            your browsing habits. This data isn't just sitting idle; it's often
            sold to advertisers or, worse, could be exposed to cybercriminals.
            The more you share, the more you risk your privacy. It's crucial to
            dig into your privacy settings and be mindful of the information you
            broadcast to the world
          </p>

          <h2>Behavioral Tracking and Profiling</h2>
          <p>
            Ever notice how ads seem eerily tailored to your recent thoughts?
            That's behavioral tracking at work. Websites and apps monitor your
            online activities—like the pages you visit and the links you
            click—to build a profile about you. This profile helps companies
            target you with personalized ads, but it also means your online
            behavior is constantly under surveillance. To keep your digital
            footprint in check, consider using tools that block trackers and
            regularly clear your browsing data.
          </p>

          <h2>Oversharing: The Risks of Public Posts</h2>
          <p>
            Sharing every detail of your life on social media might seem
            harmless, but oversharing can lead to serious privacy issues.
            Posting personal information, like your home address or vacation
            plans, can make you a target for identity theft or burglary. Even
            seemingly innocent details can be pieced together by malicious
            actors. To protect yourself, think twice before making posts public
            and consider limiting your audience to trusted friends and family.
