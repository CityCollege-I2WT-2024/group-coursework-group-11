          <h1>Your Data</h1>

          <h2>What Counts as Personal Data?</h2>
          <p>
            Personal data refers to any information that relates to an
            identified or identifiable individual. This includes obvious details
            like your name, address, and identification numbers, as well as less
            apparent information such as online identifiers, location data, and
            factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
            economic, cultural, or social identity. Essentially, if a piece of
            information can be linked to you, directly or indirectly, it's
            considered personal data.
          </p>

          <h2>How Your Data is Collected and Used</h2>
          <p>
            Your personal data is collected through various means, often without
            your explicit awareness. Websites, apps, and online services gather
            data through forms you fill out, cookies that track your browsing
            habits, and even through your interactions on social media. This
            information is then used for purposes like targeted advertising,
            improving user experience, or, in some cases, sold to third parties.
            Understanding these practices is crucial to managing your privacy.
          </p>

          <h2>The Risks of Your Data Being Misused</h2>
          <p>
            When your personal data falls into the wrong hands or is used beyond
            its intended purpose, it can lead to significant risks. These
            include identity theft, financial fraud, and unauthorized
            surveillance. Moreover, data breaches can expose sensitive
            information, leading to potential discrimination or reputational
            damage. Being aware of these risks underscores the importance of
            protecting your personal data.
          </p>
